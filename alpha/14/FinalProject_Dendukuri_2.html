				<p id="AboutTitle">Hello.</p>

				<p class="AboutDescription">I’m a product enthusiast. Founder to a product design &amp; development startup, product consultant to a startup teams, &amp; working from Bangalore, India.</p>
				<p class="AboutDescription">I started my career in visual &amp; graphic designs as a hobby while I was in college. I've moved into the internet product industry to become a UI/ UX Designer.</p>
				<p class="AboutSeperator">...</p>
				<p class="AboutDescription">I’m a graduate in Information Technology. While in college, I have tried my hands on photography, organised events like TEDx &amp; various student organisation events within the University. I also served as the Vice - President of Computer Society of India during my under-grad college.</p>
				<p class="AboutDescription">Right after that, I rejected a job opportunity from an MNC and have pursued my interests in startups. I have studied about the startup ecosystem in India that has a huge potential to up-skill the people &amp; the nation. I decided to join Startup Village, an incubator for student startups in India, to handle Incubation and Campus Operations in Visakhapatnam, India. As we pivoted into an online incubator for student startups an year later, I moved on to lead the Incubation Program to interact and mentor the student startups. </p>
				<p class="AboutDescription">I have closely watched campus startups grow from their colleges. The 3 years I spent at Startup Village has given me enormous observation &amp; learning about students in India and the campus startup ecosystem.</p>
				<p class="AboutDescription">In August 2017, I decided to step aside and start working on my personal goals. Along with two other friends, I began working on Tymline.co, our first product trial.</p>
				<p class="AboutDescription">In April 2018, I started a product design and development agency called Coalition House to help startups by building products. Forming a team with few friends who earlier designed and developed great products, we are now helping global clients in solving one problem at a time.</p>
				<p class="AboutDescription">Coalition House is giving the necessary learnings to the entire team and we are soon looking to foray into technologies that will help us all move forward, faster.</p>
